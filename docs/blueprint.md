# **App Name**: TrapRunner

## Core Features:

- Trap Management: Users can create and manage honey trap scenarios, logging interactions and categorizing incidents.
- AI-Driven Risk Analysis: An AI tool analyzes logged interactions for risk indicators, suggests appropriate responses based on patterns, predicts future risks, and detects anomalies.
- Interactive Dashboard: Display trends and insights from honey trap data using charts, graphs, and visual risk maps.
- User Role Management: Allow different access levels (admin, agent, supervisor).
- Incident Reporting and Escalation: Allow users to escalate a trap case when AI flags it as high risk and create a special dashboard section for escalated cases.
- Offline Mode / Local Storage: Offer limited offline capability (e.g., store interactions temporarily until reconnected).
- Sentiment Analysis: The AI bot can run basic tone/sentiment checks on the uploaded interactions (angry, suspicious, compliant).

## Style Guidelines:

- Employ a card-based layout to organize honey trap cases and AI analysis results.
- Primary color: Deep blue (#1A237E) for a professional and secure feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) for backgrounds and neutral elements.
- Accent: Teal (#009688) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Use clear and consistent icons from Material Design to represent actions and data categories.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience when navigating between views or receiving AI insights.

Analyze messages or behavior patterns for risk indicators.

Recommend actions or responses based on past data.

Offer conversational support to users.
